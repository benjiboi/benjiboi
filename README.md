- 👋 Hi, I’m @benjiboi
- I've been picking up coding after a year of being out of the game. I know javascript, c#, and rust, as well as being passingly familiar with a couple other.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Rust based solutions, I'm also interested in simulation software. I've mostly worked alone, but down for most stuff.
- 📫 How to reach me: Benjaminkeiding@gmail.com
